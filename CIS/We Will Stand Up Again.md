4. On one hand, it can be argued that the lack of Indigenous juries could render the sitting jury more susceptible to bad actors, who do hold prejudices against Indigenous individuals. Despite it being the legal system's responsibility to ensure that jury members are unbiased in the trial, it in nonetheless possible for an oversight to occur. However, it is also important to note that on the balance of probabilities, it is unlikely for the jury to include many Indigenous peoples in the first place. Given that many Indigenous people living inside the communnity of the incident attended or are aware of events surronding it, it would be unfair to deem them unbiased for the trial.
