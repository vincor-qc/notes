1. Russ should not have told the kids about the opportunity until he got confirmation or support from From a game theory approach, awaiting confirmation and then telling would lead to a higher outcome in the end, as otherwise, the students spirits could be destroyed the moment they are unable to afford the trip.
2. perhaps the girl wanted to protest? idk
3. The funds could be allocated to wherever is most in need of funding, which can be determined by a democratic vote. However, sometimes individuals may not be rational and decide on a location/event that may not produce the most benefit, hence, the different situations needing the funds may be evaluated for their use and purpose. The lacrosse trip for example, though not presenting as much immediate benefit as compared to fixing road, will provide a lot of social benefit, i.e., the welfare that it provides to the students will propel them to be more successful in the future, and hence provide back to the community. Given the stated circumstances in the film, I believe the current best option is to allocate the funds to the lacrosse team, unless there exists another situation that provides more total benefit.
