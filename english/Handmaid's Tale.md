- The concept of Handmaids
- The story serves aa an inspiration not only for the role of the Handmaids as "breeders", but for the entire founding of Gilead


## Philosophical

### Religion
- Everything in Gilead functions through religious beliefs
	- E.g., The name "Offred" can be interpreted as "offered", implying that Offred is a religious offering or sacrifice
	- Jacob's desire to create a world where he is the ultimate patriarch parallels the main idea behind the creation of Gilead
	- The phrase "blessed with fruit" plays as a reminder to handmaids that their only value to society is their ability to give birth
- Closely linked with the totalitarian phenomena of the Gilead society
  
### Rebellion
- Each main character rebels in diverse ways for various reasons
	- E.g., Serena Joy rebel in indirect and small ways by smoking cigarettes and telling Offred that the commander is infertile
- Treasure safety more than rebellion 
  
### Morality
- It depends on an individual's perspective and interpretation
- Twisted by religion

## Literary
- Written in the postmodernism era of literature
	- Is seen as a reaction of modernism
- Brought to light after ww2
- Characterized by 5 techniques
	1. Rejects the idea of absolutism and embraces randomness
	2. It used tools like black humour, irony, wordplay and other techniques to portray a playful tone
	3. Temporal distortion? Jumps in space.
	4. Metafiction. A self aware narrator infused their own comments into the story
	5. Intertextuality. Many postmodernism authors often draw artistic connections to other works. It is the shaping of text's meaning by another text. (Took inspiration from 1984)
- Is is also a dystopian novel
