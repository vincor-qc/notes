# Brown v. Board of Education

- *Plessy v. Freguson*: Supreme Court ruled in 1896 that segregation in public facilities was legal given that the facilities for both races was equal ("separate but equal doctrine")
- This ruling stood until the 1950s, when the NAACP began filing lawsuits challenging segregation laws in public schools
- In the case that made its way to the Supreme Court, plaintiff Oliver Brown filed a suit against the Board of Education of Topeka after his daughter was denied access to an all-white elementary school
- Argued that
	1. Schools for Black children were not equal to schools for white children, in contravention of separate but equal doctrine;
	2.  Segregation violated the 14th Amendment in that no state can "deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws".
- Initially, US District Court in Kansas upheld the original ruling in *Plessy* despite recognizing the "detrimental effect upon the colored children" and contribution to "a sense of inferiority"

## Supreme Court Verdict

- Thurgood Marshall, head of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, served as chief attorney for the plaintiffs
	- Years later, Marshall would be appointed to the Supreme Court (thereby becoming the first Black justice)
- Initially, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson held that *Plessy* should stand; however, he died before the case was to be heard in the Supreme Court
- Pres. Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as the new Chief Justice
- Warren was considerably more progressive-minded, and succeeded in convincing his fellow justices to rule unanimously against segregation
- On May 17, 1954, Warren wrote "in the field of the education of 'separate but equal' has no place" as segregated schools are "inherently unequal"
- Though the Supreme Court's ruling prohibited segregation in theory, it left implementation to lower courts, leading to some friction in practice (see, e.g., [[african-americans-post-ww2#Post-war | notes on Little Rock Nine]])
