# African Americans post WWII

## During the War
- Civilian employment rose to more than 46,000,000 in 1940, leading to a shortage in the pool of unemployed men

- Under pressure from Blacks, Pres. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8802 on June 25, 1941, which prohibited racial discrimination in defense sectors
- By the end of 1944, nearly 2,000,000 Blacks were employed in defense
- Blacks were also permitted to enlist as part of the US Army, and more than 2.5 million did so
