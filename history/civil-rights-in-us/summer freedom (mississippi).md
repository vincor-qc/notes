# Freedom Summer/Mississippi Summer Project

- **1964**, the Mississippi Summer Project aimed to increase the number of registered black voters in Mississippi.
- Over 700 mostly white americans volunteered to fight against voter intimidation and discrimination at the polls
- The movement was organized by civil rights organizations like the Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee.
- There was violent resistance from the KKK, and members of state and local law enforcement
- Overall, the movement brought attention to voter discrimination, and helped the development of the **Voting Rights Act of 1965**


## Cause
- In 1964, the civil rights movement was in full swing (Freedom Rides, MLK, March on Washington, etc.)
- Despite the movement, the south remained segregated, especially during elections
- African Americans faced violence and intimidation when they attempted to excersize their right to vote.
- Poll taxes and literacy tests also limited the ability for the African American population to vote
- In Mississippi 1962, less than 7% of the states African American population was eligible to vote

## Timeline
- On June 15, 1964, the first 300 volunteers arrived to help.
- The director Robert "Bob" Moses had pledged his staff that they would remain nonviolent
- Volunteers and staff were told to expect a high level of violence, trauma, arrests, etc.
- In the first wave of volunteers, two white students and a local black man disappeared after visiting Philadelphia, where they were investigating the burning of a church
- Despite their dissapearance and murders, the project woiuld continue
- Six weeks later, the bodies of the 3 men were found, and revealed to be killed by a KKK mob that had the help of a local policeman.

## Legacy
- The project did not achieve its initial goal
	- That year, 17000 African Americans attempted to register to vote, and only 1200 were successful
- However, the project established many freedom schools, and raised awareness for the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party
- Overall, the impacts of this movement are blurred, some say it helped bring attention to the civil rights movement, while other say it remained a background event.
