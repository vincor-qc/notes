# 13th Amendment

The Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States -- signed into law in 1865 following the conclusion of the Civil War -- formally abolished slavery. It was also the first direct mention of slavery in the Constitution.

## Founding Fathers

- Claimed to be opposed to slavery on a moral basis, but all of the earliest presidents (excluding John Adams) owned enslaved persons
- White House was built with help from slave labor
- Thomas Jefferson called slavery a "moral depravity", a "hideous blot", and an "assemblage of horrors", but continued to own slaves throughout the duration of his life
- Founding documents of the US contained no mention whatsoever of slavery

## Civil War

- **1815-1861**: the northen states' economies began to shift to industries, rather than agriculture
- They invested into transportation systems, financial industries, and communication networks
- Souther economies were based primarily on plantations which produced cotton (and cotton was extremely profitable, rendering farmer 2x richer than their northern counterparts)
- More and more Northerners began supporting abolishing slavery out of a sense of morality
- **1860**: Abraham Lincoln, candidate of the antislavery Republican Party, wins the presidential election
	- Consequently, South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas secede and form the Confederate States of America
- **April 2, 1861**: Rebels open fire on Fort Sumter, marking the beginning of the Civil War
	- More than 4 million people, nearly all of African descent, were enslaved at this time

## Emancipation Proclamation

> "[A]ll persons held as slaves within any States, or designated part of the State, the people whereof shall be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free."

- Up to 1862, Lincoln, despite being a lifelong opponent of slavery, was conflicted as to how precisely to deal with the matter
- Became convinced that emancipating slaves would help the North win the war
- As the proclamation applied to states outside Lincoln's control at the time, it had very little effect on actually freeing slaves and was therefore mostly symbolic

## Ratification

- **April 1864**: U.S. Senate passes proposed amendment banning slavery
- However, House of Representatives falters (especially Democrats, given that it was an election year)
- Lincoln secures reelection in the fall and is free to devote his energies toward garnering support
- **January 31, 1865**: House of Representatives passes the 13th amendment with a vote of 119-56; sent to state legislatures for final ratification

## Aftermath

- Lincoln is assassinated on April 14, 1865 and is thus unable to see the culmination of his life's work
- A year later, in 1866, using powers granted by the 13th amendment to facilitate enforcement, Congress passes Civil Rights Act invalidating "black codes" governing behavior of Black people
