# Sit Ins

- The sit ins movement was a nonviolent movement where African Americans (and later White Americans) would sit in all avaliable (in segregated facilities) and refuse to leave when asked to
- The movement stated in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960
- The movement detrimented business owners, as the seats would be filled with non-paying customers.


## Origin
- Sit ins were influenced by Gandhi's teaching of nonviolent "striking"
- This tactic was not only used by Civil Right activists, but also employed by unions to occupy plants of companies
- The first sit in occured with only 4 students
	- They sat at a white counter, place and order and were refused service
	- They refused to leave after being asked, until closing hour, and returned with a dozen more students the next day
- Many whites believed that blacks were content with segregation, and the sit ins would prove this stereotype false

## Growth
- More and more students (black and white) joined the movement, and hints of violence emerged
	- Despite being bombareded with threats, harrasement, etc., the protestors followed their principle of nonviolence
- Through sit ins, more and more communities of civil rights activisim emerged, and eventually evolved into to the greater Civil Rights Movement
	- The rise of a larger collective movement also meant the phasing out of the sit ins movement

## Legacy
- The movement gave birth to a new sense of pride and power for African Americans
- The sit ins movement inevitably destroyed the Jim Crow system
- Many upper Southern states desegregated as a result of the movement, but some lower Southern states did not desegregate
- Following this movement, another was born, which was the [[freedom-riders]].
