# Joseph McCarthy

## Political Career
- He was originally a quiet and undistinguished senator
- **February 1950**: He delivered a speech, claiming that 205 communists have infiltrated the State Department
- When testifying in front of the Senate Commitee, he was unable to provide the name of a single "card carrying communist".
- He gained success and popularity by maintaining the facade that there were communist imposters among U.S. government officials.
- He proceeded to instigate a crusade against communism
	- Some saw him as an American hero, while other saw him as a witch hunter
- In 1952, he obtained the chairman position for the Committee on Government Operations of the Senate
- McCarthy even went to accuse President Eisenhower, and other Republican/Democratic leaders.
- Ultimately, he was condemned by the Senate for his "inexcusable", "reprehensible", "vulgar and insulting" behavior.


## Legacy
- McCarthyism continued to persist long after he left office, where people would offen accuse others of communism without evidence
- Can be still seen in modern politics, where politicians will sometimes accuse other of being "communist" or "socialist"
