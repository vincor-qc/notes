# The Harlem Renaissance

- Harlem was a neighborhood in Manhattan originally intended for upper-class whites only
- However, landlords overestimated the demand and thus many buildings remained empty
- Out of desperation, they eventually caved in and permitted Black families to move in
	- At the outset, white residents fought to keep them out, but were ultimately unsuccessful and left the area
- As more and more Blacks migrated to the North as a result of the Great Migration, Harlem became a cultural center
- Nearly 175,000 African Americans settled in Harlem
- Between the end of WW1 and the 1930s, these individuals helped redefine African American culture through producing significant artistic works; 
- **This period of time was deemed the **Harlem Renaissance****
- Unique feature of the Harlem Renaissance was its close relationship to civil rights movements and reform organizations
- Magazines like _The Crisis_ (published by the NAACP); _Opportunity_ (published by the National Urban League) and _The Messenger_ were key parts of the movement
- Harlem Renaissance was cut short by the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression

## Key figures

- **Alain Locke:** Educator, writer, and philosopher; considered the leader of the movement
- **W.E.B. Du Bois:** Founding member of the NAACP
- **Marcus Garvey:** Activist; organized first important American Black nationalist movement
- **Langston Hughes:** Writer who wrote about the African American experience
- **Claude McKay:** Writer; authored the most popular novel written by an African American at the time of publishing, _Home to Harlem_

## The Great Migration

- About 6 million African Americans migrated from the South to the North, Midwest and West
- Though slavery was outlawed in the wake of the Civil War by the [[13th-amendment || 13th Amendment]], racial inequality persisted in the South due to so-called "Jim Crow" laws, which dictated what African Americans could and could not do
- Though Ku Klux Klan was officially dissolved in 1869, underground branches continued running

## Cause

- WWI led to a shortage of industrial laborers in the North, Midwest and West, as the war halted the tide of European immigration
- Recruiters put out advertisements in an attempt to entice Blacks to move to the north
- Black newspapers such as the *Chicago Defender* shared first-person success stories
- Around 1916, a Black factory worker in the North could expect to make approximately three times more than an equivalent farm worker in the South
- Approx. 1 million Black people left the South by the end of 1919

## Legacy

- Inspired future generations of African American creators and intellectuals
- Established authority of African Americans to define their own representation in arts and media
- Provided a foundation for future Black civil rights movements
- Certain African American writers denounced the Harlem Renaissance for its ties to White sponsors
	- Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) castigated thought leaders of the Harlem Renaissance for being *"week-kneed and cringing ... [flatterers of] the white man"*
