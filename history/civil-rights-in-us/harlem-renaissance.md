# The Harlem Renaissance

- Harlem was a neighborhood in Manhattan originally intended for upper-class whites only
- However, landlords overestimated the demand and thus many buildings remained empty
- Out of desperation, they eventually caved in and permitted Black families to move in
	- At the outset, white residents fought to keep them out, but were ultimately unsuccessful and left the area
- As more and more Blacks migrated to the North as a result of the Great Migration, Harlem became a cultural center
- Nearly 175,000 African Americans settled in Harlem (meaning it had one of the highest concentrations of black people in the world), including some of the brightest minds of the era
	- Between the end of WW1 and the 1930s, these individuals helped redefine African American culture through producing significant works of literature, music, stage performance and art; this period of time was therefore deemed the **Harlem Renaissance**
- Unique feature of the Harlem Renaissance was its close relationship to civil rights movements and reform organizations
	- Magazines like _The Crisis_ (published by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People); _Opportunity_ (published by the National Urban League) and _The Messenger_ were key parts of the movement
- Harlem Renaissance was cut short by the Stock Market Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression, wherein financial support for the arts and Black businesses dwindled

## The Great Migration

- Mass migration of ~6 million African Americans from the South to the North, Midwest and West
- Though slavery was outlawed in the wake of the Civil War by the [[13th-amendment || 13th Amendment]], racial inequality persisted in the South due to so-called "Jim Crow" laws, which dictated what African Americans could and could not do
- Additionally, though Ku Klux Klan was officially dissolved in 1869, underground branches continued running (and so the characteristic intimidation, violence, and lynching of Blacks remained a problem)

## Cause

- WWI led to a shortage of industrial laborers in the North, Midwest and West, as the war halted the tide of European immigration
- Recruiters put out advertisements in an attempt to entice Blacks to move to the north
	- Black newspapers, such as the *Chicago Defender* shared first-person success stories
- Statistics show that around 1916, a Black factory worker in the North could expect to make approximately three times more than an equivalent farm worker in the South
- Approx. 1 million Black people ended up leaving the South by the end of 1919

## Key figures

- **Alain Locke:** Educator, writer, and philosopher; considered the leader of the movement
- **W.E.B. Du Bois:** Founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
- **Marcus Garvey:** Activist; organized first important American Black nationalist movement
- **Langston Hughes:** Acclaimed writer who wrote about the African American experience
- **Claude McKay:** Writer; authored the most popular novel written by an African American at the time of publishing, _Home to Harlem_

## Legacy

- Inspired future generations of African American creators and intellectuals
- Challenged longstanding stereotypes of African Americans
	- Established authority of African Americans to define their own representation in arts and media
- Provided a foundation for future Black civil rights movements
- However, not without criticism; certain African American writers denounced the Harlem Renaissance for its ties to White sponsors
	- In particular, Marcus Garvey, founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) castigated thought leaders of the Harlem Renaissance for being "week-kneed and cringing ... [flatterers of] the white man"
