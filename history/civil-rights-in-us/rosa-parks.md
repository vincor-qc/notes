# Rosa Parks

## Life

*Early Life*
- Born in Tuskegee, Alabama on February 4, 1913 to James and Leona McCauley
- Moved at age 2 to Pine Level, Alabama, to be closer to grandparents
- Parents split in 1915
- Family relocated again to Montgomery, Alabama, when Rosa was 11
- Mother was a teacher and thus did her best to provide Rosa with a good education
- Attended high school at Alabama State Teachers' College for Negroes
- Dropped out in 11th grade to care of grandmother and later mother
- Married long-time NAACP member Raymond Parks in 1932
	- With his encouragement, Rosa finished her last year of high school the following year and earned her diploma
- Worked as a seamstress

*Later Life*
- Parks moved to Detroit in the wake of the ruling due to sustained harassment and threats
- Became an aide to Congressman John Conyers Jr. in 1965
- Co-founded Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development in 1987
- Awarded Congressional Gold Medal in 1999, the highest honor conferred upon civilians
- Died at the age of 92 on October 24, 2005

## Roots of activism

- Raymond and Rosa became respected members of the local Black civil rights community
- Despite Raymond's concerns for Rosa's safety, she ended up joining the NAACP as well and became chapter secretary, working closely with president Edgar Daniel "E.D." Nixon

## Arrest

- On Dec 1, 1955, Rosa Parks boarded a bus driven by James Blake on her way back home from work
- 12 years ago, she had clashed with Blake on a similar matter, wherein she refused to disembark and re-enter through the back door after paying her fare
- In that case, she left the bus after Blake became physically confrontational
- This time, Rosa boarded the bus and sat down in the section for Blacks at the front
	- At the time, seats on the bus were segregated by race
- Some time later, a white man boarded and, upon seeing that there was no spot available in the section for Whites, the driver ordered riders in the first row of the Black section -- including Rosa Parks -- to vacate their spots
	- Whether his request had to be obeyed by law is debatable; Montgomery laws surrounding the matter were self-contradictory
- While the other three passengers in the row obeyed the driver's command, Rosa Parks stood firm and refused to give up her spot
- When two police officers came to investigate the matter, they arrested Parks

## Aftermath

- Parks was released on bail and met her husband and E.D. Nixon at her home upon release
- E.D. Nixon had been secretly hoping for such an opportunity to arise in order to act as a catalyst for a broader civil rights movement, and convinced Parks to act as the face of said movement
	- To this end, he planned a boycott the day of Park's trial and arranged for 35,000 flyers to be sent to Black schoolchildren to spread the news
- On December 5, Parks was found guilty of violating segregation charges and fined
- Turnout in the ensuing boycott was massive; taking advantage of the momentum, Nixon formed the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and appointed Martin Luther King as president
- Lawsuits calling for the end of segregation laws went all the way to the Supreme Court
- Local white population was highly disgruntled with this; Nixon and MLK's homes were bombed
- However, that did not stop the Supreme Court from ruling bus segregation unconstitutional on November 13, 1956, marking the end of the protests
