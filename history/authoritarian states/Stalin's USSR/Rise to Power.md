>Arguing *for* the leadership of Stalin - The appointment of Stalin as leader is likely to rip the Communist party apart. Given the Stalin has the position of General Secretary of the communist party, he was able to appoint supporters of his to positions of power, and dismiss those who were against him. Given that party stability was of utmost concern — demonstrated by Lenin's constant push to establish stability — removing Stalin as the successor of a leader would therefore lead to potential widespread protest among officials who supported him.
>
> Arguing *against* the leadership of Stalin - Lenin illustrates Stalin as a rude and defective man, suggesting that he is not fit to run the part. His letter was also sent on January 4th, 1923 — a short ten days following his previous letter — which hence shows Lenin's urgence to prevent Stalin from taking over. Therefore, it shows that Stalin is incompetent and irresponsible to the degrees where Lenin was hasty to dismiss him and preventing him from assuming power.
> 
> Arguing *for* the leadership of Trotsky - Trotsky should have suceeded Lenin as the leader of the USSR given his extensive history in orchestrating the communist movement. As Trotsky was much more reserved than Stalin in terms of aggressive economic policies, such as the five year plans, it clearly demonstrates that he is a fitter leader for the USSR. 
> 
> Arguing *against* the leadership of Trotsky - Trotsky should not have become leader due to tensions between him and Stalin. Given Stalin's oppressive nature of suppressing opponents, as well as his position as General Secretary — a position capable of appointing and dismissing party members, who ultimately control the election of a leader — Trotsky's leadership would not likely have been seen favourably by Stalin and his allies. Hence, if Trotsky were to succeed, then the Communist Party  would have fractured.
