## Persuasion and Coercion
- **Persuasion**: To convince someone voluntarily to change their views/policy
- **Coercion**: Involves the use of threats/force to get someone to change their policy/views

## Seizing Power and Integrating the Masses
- Lenin believed from Marx that capitalism could be overthrown through revolution
	- He was largely concerned with two objectives: "Seizing Power" and "Integrating the masses"
- During his exile in Switzerland, he consider ideas — some stated in his class *What is to be Done?* — such as **establishing a highly centralized party that could survive the autocracy**
- He idea for the party was so that it could organize socialism, but also foster social revolution in the short run.
- To prepare for revolution, Lenin:
	- Explained to the proletariat using propaganda, the political significance and the practical organizational aspect of the revolution
	- Explained the role of mass political strikes in a revolution
	- Took steps to arm the working class and provide plans and leadership.
- Lenin faced issues from within the socialist movement, such as anarchists and luminaries

>[!tip] Iskraists
> *Iskra* is a newspaper founded and managed by Vladimir Lenin. Following the split of the RSDLP, the Mensheviks took control of the paper and it was published by Plekhanov until 1905. The group of thinkers that gathered around this paper were known as Iskraists

## Edward Bernstein and German Social Democracy
- Another issue that the Bolsheviks faced was the German Social Democratic movement
	- This group wanted to revise Marxist Doctrine — they advocated for peaceful transfer to socialism rather than violent armed revolution

>[!example] Historian Views
> **Historian Christopher Hill** explains that it was important for both ideological and organization purposes that Lenin founded the newspaper Iskra alongside other emigres

- Lenin attacked the German Social Democracy in writings in the *Iskra*
- He argued that the Germans has an entirely different social circumstance than the Russians, such as having a parliamentary tradition

## Menshevik Worries
- The Bolshevik Menshevik issues began in 1903 and reignited in 1905
- Plekhanov blamed Lenin for their failure to come together in the Second International.

## Use of force

### Trotsky
- When Trotsky returned to Petrograd on May 4, he was invited to join the Executive of the Petrograd Soviet as an associate member. 
- Lenin then invited Trotsky to join the Bolsheviks, but Trotsky declined as he wanted to remain a "free agent"
- With foresight, Trotsky began giving speeches to workers, soldiers, sailors and expanding his relationships.
- In June, both Lenin and Trotsky delivered a speech at the first All-Russian Congress of the Soviets
- They continued to pressure the government through a movement of 500 000 workers.  
- Trotsky at this point was not a Bolshevik, and part of a group called the Inter-Borough Organization.
	- Lenin continued to push for him to join, but it was interrupted by the July Days
- While the war was underway, food shortages were still present, and the currency was depreciating, more people demanded the resignation of the Provisional Government, which was followed by a demonstration on July 3
	- Lenin believed that this revolution was poorly timed, and did not have much involvement, but the right wing continued to assert that this was the doings of the Bolsheviks
	- Thus, Lenin believed that the Mensheviks were working against them
- Then followed the Kornilov Coup, and other events

### Military Revolutionary Committee (MRC
- Began to function on 21st and 23rd October
- Some of the actions that they took during this time include:
	- Sending combat units to supress counterrevolutionary members
	- Dispatched commissars to challenge the authority of Kerensky
	- Trotsky produced a declaration that removed the Provisional Government authority over the garrison
	- Took control of Peter and Paul Fortress, as well as the Kronwek Arsenal (which stored munitions)
	- Issued an order that made all commissars have unlimited veto power over military orders
- The MRC acted very tactically, and Kerensky called for all loyal troops from outside the capital.
	- The MRC responded with creating countermeasures
- The MRC and Bolsheviks then:
	- Established contact with telecommunications, railway, and postal workers
	- **Organized food supplies to stop the shortage**
	- **Payed dividends to the garrison, which made them ditch Kerensky's orders**

## Propaganda
- Propaganda was used by the Bolsheviks to socially engineer humans to create "a new kind of being"
- Underground printing presses made all sorts of propagandistic news and posters. Following the revolution, they were brought into the public
- **In the 1920s, media such as radio and film were employed extensively to promote the state.**
- *Pravda* was the chief propaganda organ for the Bolsheviks, **and Stalin was appointed as its editor in 1917**

>[!abstract] Propaganda Organs
> *Pravda*, the main organ for the Bolsheviks
> *Izvetzia*, the main organ for the Supreme Soviet and focused on foreign relations
> *Bednota*, the voice of the peasants and Red Army (during the Civil War)
> *Trud*, the organ of the trade union, which focused on economic and labour analysis
> 
> Many of these organizations survived well past the Stalin period

- Both Lenin and Stalin would effectively use propaganda to maneuver around political and social issues
- For example, "Peace, Land, Bread" and "All Power to the Soviets" were slogans, similar to propaganda, that rallied the masses
- Stalin would use propaganda to promote the success of the five year plans
- Propaganda was also used within the Bolsheviks to discredit rivals and opposition

>[!example] Historian Views
>**Historian Robert H. McNeal**, in *The Bolshevik Tradition*, noted that propaganda was employed to organize a cell in every military unit
