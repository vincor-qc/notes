# Economic Factors
During periods of economic disaster (especially in **agricultural and industrial** development), governments will test economic strategies to their limit. Thus drove Sergei Witte and Pyotr Stolypin to reform Russia
 
## Sergei Witte
- Believed in the importance of tariffs to protect markets and sustain the domestic industry
- He believed in **State Capitalism**

>[!tip] State Capitalism
> A system of capitalism where the government would control all (or a significant portion) of commercial activity for profit. Similar to modern China.

- Through this, he accomplished:
	- Increasing oil and coal production in Ukraine and the Caucuses
	- Raised capital abroad
	- Established tariffs, and increased domestic taxes
	- **1897**, place Russia on the gold standard
	- Developed the Trans Siberian Railway

## Pyotr Stolypin
- Adopted a policy to improve agriculture
- Promoted a land bank which could help peasants afford land purchases
- This would help **"wager on the strong and sober"**, which would help peasants become more independent

>[!tip] "Wager on the strong and sober"
> Quote from Stolypin, which asserts that having peasants on their own land (as done in other parts of Europe) was the best way to produce a productive and conservative society (and also bolster the Russian Economic).

>[!example] Historian Views
> **Historian Hugh Seton-Watson** praised Witte's economic policies. However, many other historians claimed that Witte's policies were ineffective, as they kept prices high (due to tariffs) and focusing too much on heavy industry.
> 
> **Economist Alec Nove** asserted that despite Russia being the least developed European power, it was still a power nonetheless.

## Bolsheviks
- Bolsheviks did not initially plan how to run the economy
- The Communist Manifesto and Marxist philosophies provided a critique and analysis of Capitalism, but did not provide considerable and thorough thought into a socialist economy either.
- Hence, Lenin employed a sort of State Capitalism to fix the unaccounted economic policy, named **War Communism**

>[!tip] War Communism
> A system where:
> a) The state allocated resources
> b) Private enterprises were banned
> c) The state seized all of the peasants' production

- **1921**, internal trade became a key point of the Bolsheviks, which demanded that peasants learn to trade (the slogan *uchites' torgovat* which translates to "learn to trade" was launched)

# Social Factors

## Social Divisions
- The two most prominent social issues faced by Russia before the war was the agrarian and industrial crises. 

>[!quote] Alec Nove (1980)
> Russia was "well behind the major industrialized Western Powers"

- Rural serfs faced issues such as taxation, and solutions such as land banks and moving to Siberia did not prove successful.
- Overcrowding became an urban problem, as Russia population nearled doubled from 1863 to 1897 (grew to 12.1 million). This then increased 20% through WWI
- New reforms made it so that:
	- Female miners were banned
	- Child labor (under 12) became illegal
	- 11.5 workday came in 1896
	- Factory inspection came
- These reforms did not fix the social problems at all
