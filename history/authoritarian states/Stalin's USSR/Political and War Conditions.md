## Weakness
- Three official bodies of the Tsar's authority
	- Imperial Council (advisors)
	- Cabinet of Ministers (ran gov. departments)
	- Senate (supervised functioning of the law)
- The Russian Orthodox Church was firm in maintaining the status quo
- There was no free speech, and opposition was forced underground

## WWI
- Briefly distracted citizens from domestic issues
- Many issues plagued the Russians, which were mainly:
	- A weak arms industry
	- Poor communication systems
	- Required to mobilize a huge army
- Patriotic bodies were formed, such as:
	- The Union of Zemstva (to provide medical facilities)
	- **Aug 1914**, a Congress of Representative of industry and Trade (coordinate wartime production)
	- Municipal organizations and Zemstvo merged, creating the **All-Russian Zemstva Union and Union of the Cities (ZemGor)**

### WWI Consequences
- Russia was cut off from its allies, and it began fully retreating by 1915

>[!example] Historian Views
> **Economist Alec Nove** notes that morale in the army was low due to the horrible losses it suffered, and the people were tired of bearing the sacrifices imposed from war.

- Tsar did not want to step down as Supreme commander of the Russian army, as he was motivated by a **deep sense of responsibility** (and thus failed to see the disadvantages).
- Mikhail Rodzyanko () writes to the Tsar claiming that his action to displace (and overtake) the Supreme Commander-in-Chief as a move inspired and caused by the Germans. He writes that the Tsar should remain a beacon of hope for the people, and not risk it in case the war is lost
- To compensate for their lost finances, **Russia went off the gold standard to print money**
	- This led to mass inflation and the Ruble becoming worthless
- Famine:
	- The army comandeered horses and trains; thus, they could no longer be used for agriculture and transporting food
	- Access to chemical fertilizers was reduced
	- Due to the famine, many peasants began hoarding food instead of selling it, exacerbating the problem
- Many believed that Rasputin was controlling the country through Nicholas' wife
