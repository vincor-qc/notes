- Apartheid was considered to be implemented the moment the NP won its election in 1948
- In many ways, Apartheid served as an extension to the segregated system that came before it
- It was not just about stricter laws, but also institutionalizing racism into SA society

>[!danger] Important
> Apartheid developed in **two** stages:
> 1. **Petty Apartheid**
> 	- This period is commonly associated with Malan and Strijdom rule.
> 	- It is often portrayed as negative.
> 	- Its primary purposed was to ensure complete domination (socially, economically, politically) of Whites over Blacks
> 	  
> 2. **Grand Apartheid**
> 	- This was initiated by HF Verwoerd in the lates 1950s
> 	- This part of apartheid was more ideologically sophistacted
> 	- Its primary objective was to enforce complete territorial segregation
> 	- It wanted Blacks to achieve full independance, and aimed to establish some moral legitimacy in an increasingly hostile global community.

### The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act
- The Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was designed to promote the separation of races
- It is the first major law passed by the NP government
- It made it illegal for Whites to marry blacks

### The Immorality Act
- This, also like the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages act, promoted seperation of races through the seperation of sexual relations
- This extended the previous acts and made it illegal for Whites to have relations with any colored person, not just blacks
- It did not prevented colored people of different races from marrying each other

### The Reservation of Separate Amenities Act
- This is considered the epitome of the petty apartheid system
- It essentially seperated races for all public ammenities
- Many public services were already segregated, e.g., buses, trains, toilets, etc., but this act took it much further
- Seperate entrances and service counters were not mandatory for buildings
- Signs informing the public about a "White Persons Only" area were now erected

### The Pass Laws Act
- This law replaced the existing passbooks with a more comprehensive one
- The pages were incredibily detailed and included everything from tax credits, employment records and any past encouters with the polices
- A permit had to be obtained for Blacks to travel to the city from a rural area
- It allowed authorities to further enforce segregation, as now police could track their movement

### The Group Areas Act
- It was designed to bring total residential segregation in urban areas
- It would remove nonwhites from inner city areas, which would then be turned into Whites only areas
- It was based on their belief that African were rural people, and thus had no place in the city
- Many Indians were targeted, as they had many shops present in the urban areas. Thus, the Group Areas Act was used to remove them, and their white competitors rejoiced
- When the coloured people were resettled, it led to new townships comprised of coloured people, on of which was known as **Sophiatown**

>[!info] Sophiatown
>It was a predominantly black neighbourhood that was near Johnassburg. It remained one of the only parts of the country, where Africans could legally own property. 
>
>Due to this, it was inevitable before government officials forcefully evicted residents, and demolished their homes.

### The Bantu Education Act
- It forced schools to admit children from one racial group only.
- The curriculum for Africans had no academic content at all (except for basic numeracy and literacy)
	- This was done in order to push Africans towards manual labor jobs or unskilled labor jobs
- There was also a massive difference in salaries for black and white teachers, which made many black teachers leave their jobs
- Bantu education also pushed a Christian nationalist message.

### The extension of University Education Act
- This abolished allowing a smaller number of universities to register students of all races. 
- Essentially, all universities will now only be able to admit only one race group
- This policy was implemented by **Verwoerd**

### The Bantu Authorities Act

### The Promotion of Bantu Self-Government Act
