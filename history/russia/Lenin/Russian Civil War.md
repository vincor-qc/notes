## Consolidation of Power and Policies
- Second Congress of Soviets declared itself the authority of Russia following the demise of the PG
	- Many people still reluctant to accept bolsheviks as primary power (e.g., the state bank did not hand over reserves until threatened with force).
- Lenin stuck to his word and enacted a decree on "peace" and "land"
- Landowners were not compensated as the land belonged to the people
	- Peasant ownership was granted (i.e., they owned it together) as it would reduce their support for the SR.
- Many workers began taking over closed factories, and this was furthered by a "worker's control decree" issued in November 1917
- Ranks were also removed in the military
- Another decree in November 1917 promised self-determination to many former people's of Imperial Russia
	- This furthered separatist movements in the minority states, such as Finland, the Baltic states, and the Cossacks.
- Old legal system was also abolished and changed
- Outlawed sex discrimination and gave women the right to own property (in hopes of gaining female support)
- The church was also attacked by the government, having their land seized, as well as marriage and divorce rights stripped away
- Nationalization of banks led to less private capitaliszation

## Suppression of Opposition
- Anti-bolshevik newspapers were banned
- Upperclassmen known as the *bourgeoisie* were deemed enemies
- When *Cheka* was established (the All Russian Commission for the Suppression of Counter-Revolution, Sabotage and Speculation) was established, it led many of the other parties (e.g., Kadets, SR) to demand the Bolsheviks be overthrown
- Elections were held, but in the first one, the Bolsheviks lost
	- Hence, Lenin decided to reject the election results
