## Beginning
- Many workers were already striking, and many were unemployed and discontent
- On International Women's Day (Feb 23), many women took to the streets to protest
	- Mainly protested about lack of food
		- Rumoured that it would soon be rationed due to the war
- The women protestors were later joined by men from metal works, militant students, as well as many other people.
- Revolution was **unplanned**
- Later, they:
	- Halted the Russian transport network
	- Closed down newspaper publications
	- Forced closures of many shops
	- Tore down statues and symbols of the Tsar

## Nicholas
- Nicholas was detached from reality and did not believe Rodzianko that a revolution was breaking out
- Nicholas instead ordered his commanders to retake the city by military force
	- Most of the troops were newly enlisted members. Most were young and came from peasant/worker background.
	- They were disgusted to be shooting their fellow Russians
	- They began to mutiny
- Feb 28, the entire Petrograd garrison had mutinied, taking their weapons with them
- Some sailors also mutinied
- Soldiers also began accepting the soviets as the authority over Nicholas

- **Nicholas' Abdication:**
	- **Feb 28**: Nicholas left the military base of Mogilev to return to Petrograd
		- His train was diverted by rebellious railway workers
		- After forcing to stop, he was given a sincere description of the situation by members of the Duma.
			- This finally moved him to abdicate
	- Nicholas did not want his son Alexei to take the throne (mainly due to health issues)
	- The throne was then given to his brother, but he refused to take the position due to the shear amount of chaos
	- Hence, Russia was left without a Tsar


## Historian Interpretations
- Western liberals tend to place the blame on Nicholas himself, citing that Russia was on the path of economic reform and prosperity (until ruined by Nicholas after WWI).
- Some also argue that Nicholas' character — weak and of having no grasp of politics — was the primary cause of his and Russia's downfall.
- Soviet historians of the communist era argue that the revolution was a cause of economic turmoil and class struggle.
- Both western and soviet historians agree that the revolution was leaderless and spontaneous
