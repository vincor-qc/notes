## Dual Power
- The provisional government grew out of the former State Duma
- Most people were in favour of a constitutional monarchy, i.e., most were liberals, moderate socialists, and Constitutional Democrats.
- Chairman was named **Georgi Lvov**
- Nicholas' brother who reject Tsardom, Alexandrovich passed authority to the Provisional Government
	- He indicated that he wanted the Provisional Government to hold elections as soon as possible (and for the PG to be only a temporary fix)
- As the Provisional Government was mainly self-appointed, the general public — including peasants and workers — saw it as untrustworthy
	- Hence, **many workers had much more faith in the soviets**
- **The Soviets**:
	- Many soviets across the country sprang up
	- The first **All-Russian Congress of Soviets** met in Petrograd in **June 1917**
	- The Soviets were much more well received by the public than the Provisional Government
- Negotiations between the PG and the Soviets were conducted by Alexander Kerensky (who was the only person)
- The Soviets agreed with the PG to cooperate
	- The PG welcomed the Soviets, as they had control of the masses (and did not demonstrate an too far left ideology at the time)
	- The soviets received many concessions, such as basic civil liberties, abolition of legal inequalities due to class, religion, or nationality, etc.
- The PG's early decrees were welcomes by the people
	- They brought about freedom of religion
	- Removal of punishment for soliders who previously desserted
	- Replaced the Tsarist military force with a 'people's militia'

## Problems with Dual Power
- The PG and Soviets still had two very different ideologies
- WWI was still ongoing, and many peasants simply did not want to fight the Germans
- Kerensky appointed Kornilov as commander in chief of the army
- Kornilov began to scheme a takeover of the PG, so Kerensky panicked
	- Kerensky called in the Soviets to help prevent this takeover
	- Kerensky provided weapons to the soviets, and the takeover was stopped
- The government was very inefficient, and the people became alienated
- Many workers claimed that the PG was illegitimate, and only took orders from the Soviets

## Bolshevik Revolution
- Lenin returned in April, and made the promise of **"peace, land, bread"** that resonated with many people.
- There were riots known as 'The July Days', which ended with Lenin fleeing to Finland after being accused to being a German agent
- When Kerensky gave weapons to the Soviets to prevent Kornilov's coup, it was a bad idea
	- The Bolsheviks later seized
