- Between 1905 and 1914, the Russian economy enjoyed a period of growth
- Nicholas remained detached from societal developments due to concerns with his son
- Wife met Rasputin in 1905

## WWI
### Beginning (1914)
- Russian state supported Serbia, as they wanted to create a new southern slav state
- Russian political and military higher ups warned Nicholas of the dangers of war
- Some people saw a war as a means of diverting attention away from internal problems
	- This succeeded in a sense, where protests stopped following patriotic enthusiasm
	- Crowds gathered at Moscow and St. Petersburg to celebrate and sing
- The Duma supported the war efforts through voting for war credits (raising money to pay for warn expenses through bonds)
	- The Bolsheviks opposed this
- President of the Duma (Mikhail Rodzianko) also set up efforts to aid war victims
  
### Downfall (1914 - 1915)
- Public enthusiasm did not last forever, and ended after about 6 months
- The Russians were defeated in the Battle of Tannenberg in Aug 1914, as well as another battle near Masurian Lakes
	- This led the public to be discontent, as it was unlikely to be a short and victorious war
- Economic strain was also placed on the country following the war
- Efforts to provide relief from outside organizations:
	- The Zemstva came together in an All-Russian Union of Zemstvas for the relief of the sick and wounded
	- Representative of industry also came together to form the Central War Industries Committee, which saw worker's duma and industrialists representatives set up a group to coordinate war production.
	- June 1915: the zemstva and municipal dumas merged to form the All-Russian Unions of Zemstvas and Cities
	- Nicholas viewed these establishments as unwanted liberal ideas

### Failure (1915)
- Mid 1915, there was zero support for the war
	- Russia lost parts of the Balkan states, as well as parts of Ukraine and Poland.
- There was a lack of ammunition and supplies
- During this time, the Duma tried to come together to persuade Nicholas into giving them more power (all parties formed a majority coalition).
	- Nicholas rejected this
- After, he tried to take up the position of Commander in Chief of the Russian Army and Navy (as an incompetent person)
	- This distanced him from the government and internal discontent
	- He left his wife and Rasputin in charge of the country while he was gone
		- Known as 'tsarina' period
- During the tsarina period, there were:
	- 4 Prime ministers
	- 5 Agricultural ministers
	- 5 Interior ministers
	- 3 Foreign, war, and transport ministers
	- Hence, this shows the disorganization when Nicholas II was gone
- Rodzianko warned Nicholas about the discontent regarding Rasputin, but he did nothing in response
	- Three members of Nicholas' inner circle (elites) murdered Rasputin in December 1916
	- However, this did little to change the circumstances in Russia
- Many army generals supported Nicholas' abdication
- Nicholas himself was completely unaware of the issues, in fact, he was more concerned with his children's measles

>[!info] Mikahil Rodzianko
> He came from a wealthy family, served as a senior military officer, and ultimately led the Duma starting in 1911. Although he supported Nicholas II, he opposed Rasputin and tried to persuade the Tsar into reform (in 1917) to avoid revolution. Following the Tsar's abdication, he supported the new Provisional Government.
