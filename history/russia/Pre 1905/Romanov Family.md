## Intro
- The final ruler of the Romanov Dynasty was Tsar Nicholas the II

## Nicholas the II
- "Nicholas the Bloody" was a common nickname
- Poor leadership, lost to Japan in attempt to expand (Russo-Japanese war)
	- Peasants held a protest, but was met with police fire in what is known as **Bloody Sunday**
- Dooma was a "democratic" assembly he created to appease the peasants
- Alexis suffered from hemophilia
	- Lessened his pain by Rasputin, and gained trust to the Tsars

## Downfall
- March 1917: Announced a rationing to the citizens of Russia
	- Led to a protest in Petrograd by woman
	- When troops were sent, there was mutiny and they joined the protestors
- March 15, 1917: Romanov Family officially ended
	- Nicholas abdicated when the Dooma annouced that they were assuming power
- They were arrested and confined into their house

>[!info] The White Army
>A military force that remained loyal to the Tsars even after their arrests and Bolshevik takeover

## Soviet Involvement
- The October Revolution saw Lenin planning to put Nicholas on trial and execute him
- Bolsheviks ultimately killed Tsar Nicholas and his family
- To prevent prevent public outrage from learning about the gruesome assassination of the family, the Bolsheviks only claimed they had killed Nicholas.
	- Thus, numerous imposters claimed to be the survivors of the Royal family
