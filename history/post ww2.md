# African Americans post WW2

## During the War
- They were drafted to fight in the war after troop reserves were being depleted
- When they came home, they were decorated, but eventually ended up at the bottom of the social ladder again

## Post War
- National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was formed to help these marginalized groups find education and a place in society
- The Eisenhower presidency (1953-1961) moved to abolish segregated schools
- In Brown v. Board of Education, The Supreme Court decided that schools should be desegregated.
- Freedom rides (insipired from Rosa Parks), was a movement where white Americans and African Americans sat toghther and rode buses across the nation.
- 1964, three freedom riders (two white, one black), were tortured, lynched and killed.

## Reformations
- Many reforms were passed as a result of 1956-65 protests:
	- The Civil Rights of 1964, promised equal employment for all
	- The Voting Rights were signed in 1965, and gave African Americans the right to vote'

## The Media's Role
- During this time, television was born and live reporting became more and more accessible
- At the times, news repoting was not very analytical, but rather only reported the event


## Communism and African American Rights
- Both of these movements advoated for 'equality' (although they were different), and suddenly, proponents of African American equality found themselves labelled communists
