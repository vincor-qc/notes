- A thin boundary layer is formed near any surface, as flowing air adheres to the surface.
	- Hence, the velocity of the flow at the boundary layer has a smaller velocity than flow away from the surface
- Reynolds number is given by:
  $$Re_x = \frac{\rho u_\infty x}{\mu} = \frac{u_\infty x}{v}$$
- The average nusselt number for laminar flow is given by:
  $$\ce{Nu_L} = \frac{hL}{k} = \pu{0.664Re_x^{1/2}Pr^{1/3}}$$
- Newtons law of cooling:
  $$Q = hA(T - T_{env} )$$
$$T(t) = T_{env} + (T_o - T_{env})e^{-hAt}$$
