# Kinematics

| X | Definition | Symbol | Units | Vector or Scalar |
|-----|-------------|------------|---------|-------|
| Distance, Length| A measure of the space between two points| d or L | meters (m) | Scalar |
| Position | Location of a point in relation to a reference point | d | (x,y,z) in a cartesian plane (in meters) | Vector |
| Displacement | The change in position | s or d | meters | Vector |
| Velocity | Rate of change in position | v | $\pu{ms^{-1}}$ | Vector | 
| Speed | Rate of distance travelled per unit time | v | $\pu{ms^{-1}}$ | Scalar | 
| Average Velocity | Total speed over total time | $\pu{v_{avg}}$ | $\pu{ms^{-1}}$ | Vector |
| Instantaneous Velocity | Velocity as time approaches 0 | v | $\pu{ms^{-1}}$ | Vector |

>[!danger] Exam Tip
>In IB, **Displacement** is the same as position, but the reference from is the original position of the object
