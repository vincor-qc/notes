# Graphing
Graphing is a way to see
1. If a relationship exists between two variables
2. What a relationship looks like

## Types of Variables

**Controlled Variables:** Variables that are kept constant in an experiment

**Independent Variables:** The variable changed in acontrolled way during the experiments. *Usually plotted on the x axis.*

**Dependant Variable:** The variable you measure. *Usually plotted on the y axis.*


## Sketch vs. Drawn Graphs

**Sketch Graphs** are used to show qualitative trends (direct or inverse) abnd the axes are *labelled but unscaled*.

**Drawn Graphs** are used to make quantitative measurements from data.
They must include:
1. Title
	- Must state the actual variables being compared, usually in the form of "Dependant variable vs. Independant variable"
	- The title should be at the top of the graph or in the top part of the graph line portion
2. Axes and Labels
	- Time is often the independant variable, and plotted on the x axis
	- Y axis is for the dependant variable
	- All measured variables have units, axis should reflect that.
3. Zero Point
	- Should be plotted if and only if two vartiables represent a valid piece of data when they both have a value of zero. 
	- The data recorded or given to your, may not actually state this information but the point should be included on the graph. 
	- If there is not a real zero point, or you do not know if one is possible, you should not include one on your graph.
4. Axis scale uniformity and full use of graph
	- Each axis scale should be linear and have regular divisions of the scale values
	- Use scientific notation for very small or large numbers. **No Fractions!**
	- Do not make a scale out of only your actual data points. For each varible, look at the upper and lower values of each set of data and make a scale to fit that data.
	- *Use the full piece of graphing paper.* Do not draw a small graph in a corner if the paper is large.
	- The Y axis does not need to start at zero. Shift the axis to have a better view at the data.
5. Ploting and interpreting the data
	- Place each (x, y) data point on the graph as close to the values recorded as possible. Make sure all your plotted data points are visible on the graph
	-  Check [[graphing#Data Shapes]]
	- Ensure to use a ruler for linear data.
6. Interpreting
	- A graph is not complete until you show the relationship of the variable with a line or a curve
	- Data points that do not fall withint the trend of the other may represent errors
	- Never connect the dots of the data, since each of them will carry uncertainty errors
	- Our best fit line or curve is the best representation of the relationship between two variables.
	- Interpolation *must be shown* on the graph, where nessecary.

**Charles Law**
- For every 1 degree Celcius Increase, the volume of gas, if pressure is held constant, increased by a factor of 1/273
- If the volume of any gas is extrapolated to 0L, the hypothetical temperature is -273C

## Data Shapes

1. Linear: A straight line, which can be extended or extrapolated. **(Check Example graph Topic 5 in the paper sheets)
2. A curve, cannot be extended or extrapolated beyond the points plotted. 
3. No Relationship: Just like IB students.
