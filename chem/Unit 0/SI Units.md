# SI Units

- Stands for Système Internationale d'unités, a non-static system derived from the 7 base units
- It is non-static because the numbers change as the precision of measurements change

## SI Symbols
- Symbols are almost always lower-case letters unless it is named for a person (except for L, liters)
- Full names are usually written in lower case letters (except for degrees Celcius)
- Unit symbols are never pluralized
- Symbols should only be followed by a period at the end of a sentence "The penny had a mass of 2.25 g."
- There is a space between the number value and the unit symbol (5.2 g not 5.2g)


## Unit Prefixes

- **Mega (M):** $10^6$
- **Kilo (k):** $10^3$
- **Base:** $10^0$
- **Deci (d):** $10^{-1}$
- **Centi (c):** $10^{-2}$
- **Milli (m):** $10^{-3}$
- **Micro (u):** $10^{-6}$
- **Nano (n):** $10^{-9}$

## Temperature Conversions
- Kelvin is the SI unit for temperature, but seldom used in real life. Celsius is the most common scale in most contries.
- Farenheit is the Imperial Unit used in the US

$$ \text{celcius} = (\text{fahrenheit value} - \pu{32F}) \times \frac{5}{9}$$

**Celcius** is based on the freezing and boiling point of water
**Kelvin** is based on the absolute zero point where all atomic activity stops
**Fahrenheit** scale was named after a physicist in 1712 on the lowest temperate he could reproduce a cool brine


## Derived Quantity

- A derived quantity is a number made by combining two or more other values
- A derived unit is a unit made by combining two or more other units
- The density of a pure substance is constant at a particular temp and pressure

**Examples:**
1. Rate (meters per second) = $\pu{m s^{-1}}$
2. Density (grams and meters) = $\pu{g mL^{-1}}$
