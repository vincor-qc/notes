# Errors

## Systematic Errors
Also known as determinate errors, and these affect the *accuracy* of a result.

- Caused by indentifiable causes, and can often be eliminated by *optimizing an experiement*.
- Will give you consistent results, that are either too high or too low.

**Types:**
1. Methodology errors
	- For example, not properly insulating a heat-related experiement
2. Instrumental errors
	- For example, using an uncalibrated pH meter
3. Personal errors
	- For example, reading a graduated cylinder incorrectly


## Random Errors
Also called indeterminate errors, and they affect the *precision* of a result.

- Comes from the measurement limitations of the apparatus or technique.
	For example, using a beaker to measure a small volume of liquid when a volumentric pipette would deliver a more precise volume
- Not always easy to indentify as they have an equal probability of being higher or lower than expected

**Types:**
1. Observational
	For example, estimating a volume between 2 graduations or attempting to stop a timer at the exact moment
2. Environmental
	Trying to read a scale but people keep walking by
