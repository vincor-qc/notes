Is the percentage by mass, of a species in a chemical formula.

The chemical formula gives its chemical composition in terms of moles of atoms. For example, 1 mol of $\ce{H_2S}$ moles contains 2 moles of $\ce{H}$ atoms and 1 mole of $\ce{S}$ atoms

The most direct way to determine percent composistion of a compound is to decompose it into its component elements

>[!info] How to Calculate:
>1. Calculate the molar mass of the compound/molecule
>2. Calculate the molar mass of the species within the compound/molecule

>$$\text{Percent Composition} = \frac{\text{mm of Species}}{\text{mm of Compound/Molec.}} \times \text{100\%}$$

> Show that you've rounded for % compositions


## Types of Formulas
1. **Empirical Formula (EF)** - Is the simplest ratio of the different types of atoms in a compound.
2. **Molecular Formula (MF)** - Is the actual number of each type of atom in each molecule.
3. **Structural Formula (SF)** - Shows how the atoms in a molecule are arranged and how the atoms are connected

- Molecules with the same MF but different SF are called isomers
- Ionic compounds have EF, and their SF are lattices!
- Covalent compounds have EF, MF, and SF.
	- E.g., Ethane, $\ce{C_2H_4}$ and propene $\ce{C_3H_6}$ all have an EF of $\ce{CH_2}$ but have different MF and SF
