# Matter

- Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space, and chemistry is the sutdy of matter


## Observation
- Qualitative observation is any observations that is observed, e.g., a color, warmth, etc.
- Quantitative observation is any data that needs a measuring device to get it, e.g., temperature, length, etc.
- Interpretation is an inference based on an observation, adds meaning to the observation. A $[\text{CO}_2]$ of $\pu{500ppm}$ means the ventilation is pretty good.

## Kinetic Molecular Theory
- All matter is made up of tiny particles
- There is empty space between the particles
- Particles are always moving (unless at absolute zero Kelvin)
- Particles move because they have energy. The amount of energy the particles have detemine how fast and how far they will move.

## Energy
There are three types of kinetic energy a molecule can posses.
1. **Rotational energy** - causes a molecule to rotate about an axis (frisbee)
2. **Vibrational energy** - cause the length of a bond to change (slinky)
3. **Translational energy** - causes a molecule to move about in space (throw a ball). When a substance is heated, translational energy causes bonds to break.

*If a substance is continually heated, a phase change may occur.*

**Heat** - A measure of the energy transferred from a hot body to a colder one
**Temperature** - A measure of the average kinetic energy of the atoms or molecules in a system.

## States of Matter

A foruth state, *plasma*, has all the properties of a gas expcet that is composed of charged particles. 

**Examples of plasma:** northern lights, lightning, fusion reactors, Tesla coils, neon lights, the Sun.

**Temperature and pressure** affect which state matter is in.

1. **Solids**
   - Fixed shape and volume therefore not so all particles in direct contact with each other, therefore, not compressible.
   - Very small change in volume when heated or subected to pressure
   - Posses vibrational energy only.
2. **Liquids**
	- Fixed volume but takes the shape of the continaner
	- Particles in close contact with each other and can slide past one another, but are not compressible.
	- Contains vibrational and rotational energy
3. **Gases**
	- Take the shape and volume of the container.
	- Highly compressible beacuse particles are widely separated and only contact each other during collisions
	- Volume drastically altered by changing temperature and pressure.

## Physical and Chemical Properties

### Physical
- Can be found without creating a new substance; illustrates the relationship between energy and state of matter.
- For example, you can look at colour, hardness, melting point, etc., without changing the substance.
  
>[!info]
	>**Extensive** = depends on the amount of substance present (mass, volume).
	>
	>**Intensive** = depends only on the nature of the substance, not how much is present (density, MP, BP)

*We use intensive properties to indentify a pure substance from another*

**Evidence of physical change**
- Change in size or shape
- Change in phase
- Usually reversible

*Energy changes usually do not accompany physical changes, except in phase changes, and when substance dissolve*

### Chemical
- A substance's tendency to undergo chemical reactions (reactivity) and change into new substances, either by itself or with other susbtances.
- Describes the relationship between the substance and other forms of matter.

**Evidence of Chemical Change**
- Light or heat is given off
- Bubbles formed (gas evolved)
- Color change
- A precipitate forms
- Can be diffcult to reverse

>[!info]
>**Energy changes always accompany chemical changes!**

**Examples**
1. Water gets warmer when sodium hydroxide dissolves in it (P)
2. Hydrochloric acid reacts with potassium hydroxide to prosuce a salt, water and heat (C)
3. A pellet of sodium is sliced into two (P)
4. Water is heated and evporates (P)
5. Potassium chlorate decomposes to potassium chloride and oxygen (C)
6. Iron rusts (C)
7. Acid on limestone produces carbon dioxide gas (C)
8. Milk sours (C)
9. A tire is inflated with air (P)
10. Pancakes cooking on a griddle (C)

## The phase diagram of water
![[Pasted image 20221003130759.png]]
*The phase diagram of water*

- Supercritical fluid is like a 4th phase. For water, it is like a dense water vapour and is used to generate nuclear energy. Supercritical $\ce{CO_2}$ is used to decafifeinate coffee.

## Heating and Cooling Curve of Water

*Page 3, Oxford IB Chemistry*

>[!warning] Exam Tip
**$\Delta\ce{H^\circ_{fus}}$ = Heat of fusion** - The amount of heat required to convert a solid at its melting point into a liquid without an increase in temperature.
>
**$\Delta\ce{H^\circ_{vap}}$ = Heat of vaporization** - The heat required to transform a given quantity of substance into a gas at a given pressure. It is the difference in potential energy between the liquid and gas states without an increase in termperature. 

*Gases release the same amount of heat when they liquefy*

**Why is $\Delta\ce{H^\circ_{vap}} > \Delta\ce{H^\circ_{fus}}$ (why is the plateau longer)?**
It takes more energy to go from liquid to gas, than from solid to liquid.

**Why doesn't temperature change during a phase change?**
All of the energy is ysed to change phase. Once all of the substance is phase changed, then the energy will be used to increase temperature.

### Melting Point
An intensive property, unique to that substance if pure.
- It is a measure of the strength of attractive forces (bonds and forces between molecules) and mass/symetry of the particles.
- Temperature at which solid changes to liquid
- Freezing point is the same termerature

### Boiling point
An intensive property, unique to that substance if pure.
- Highest temperature in the liquid state at a given pressure
- Condensation point is same temperature
- Substances that are volatile will easily evaporate. *They have high vapor pressure, and low boiing point.*

## Classifying Matter

*Page 6, Oxford Chemistry*

### Homogeneous
- Relatively uniform, appears the same throughout, the mixture is the same no matter where its sampled.
- Solutions are homogenous mixtures where a solute is dissolved in a solvent and the resulting particles are very small ($\pu{10^{-9}m}$)
- Concentraltion `[ ]` (denoted with these brackets), is a measure of the amount of solute in a solution, usually in $\pu{g L^{-1}}$
- **Special homogenous mixtures: Colloids**
	- A mixture of 2 phases of matter
	- Appear homogenous to the naked eye, but are made up of tiny, dispersed particles between 1nm and 1um, distributed in a solid liquid, or gas
	- Colloid particles can be in a different phase than what they are suspended in.
	- Remain suspended indefinitely (don't settle out)
	- Example: fog, mayonaise
	- *Tyndall Effect:* Scattering of light by colloidal particles; fog is water or ice suspended in air

|Type of solution| Example|
|--- |------------------------|
| Gas in Gas | Air (oxygen, nitrogen) |
| Gas in Liquid | Coca Cola |
| Liquid in Liquid | Water and alcohol |
| Solid in Liquid | Salt in Water |
| Solid in Solid | Alloys |

### Heterogenous
- Compotition varies from position to position within the samples and one or more components is visible to the naked eye.
- **Special Heterogeneous Mixtures: Suspensions**
	- Particles are larger than in solutions or colloids and dispersed.
	- Because of their greater size, they will settle out (sediment) if left standing
	- Usually solids in liquids or gas

## Physical Seperation of Mixtures

### Mechanical
1. **Density Seperation** - Particles with higher density than the medium will sink (sediment)
	- Decanting - Pouring off liquid leaving sediment
	- Filtration - Seperates solid from liquid; pouring through a filter (filter is the filtrate, sediment is the residue)
2. **Magnetic Separation** - Iron filings are magnetic, can seperate them out of mixtures of other metals
3. **Centrifugation** - Rapid spinning increases sinking of particles.
	- Used for seperating components of blood (red blood cells and platelets sink to bottom, plasma on top; all drugs and metabolities end up in plasma)


### Non Mechanical
1. **Chromatography** - A family of techniques used to separate complex mixtures.
	- There is a stationary phase (does not move) and a mobile phase (does move) which seperates components based on their:
		- Relative boiling point (Ggas chromatography)
		- Relative polarity (high performance liquid chromatography)
		- Solubility in solvent (paper chromatography)
- **Paper Chromatography** - Method of analyzing complex mixtures (ink) by separating them into their primary colour components. 
	- Relies on Rf value (ratio of front) as follows:
	- ![[Pasted image 20221005124910.png]]
	- [Youtube | Paper Chromatograph Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOhefwQBAbI)
- **Evaporation** - Seperates solid from liquid. Liquid is boiled away and solid is left over.
- **Distillation** - Seperates liquids from liquids based on their different boiling points. Components are the removed from the homogenous mixture one by one, the liquid with the lowest boiling point is collected first.
