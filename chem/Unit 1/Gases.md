## General Characteristics
- Will expand to fit the container
- Can be compressed
- Collide with the walls of the container and create pressure
- Can be measured in volume

- Gases are considered "ideal" if their collisions are elastic and do not result in chemical reaction products
- Gases behave "ideally" under conditions of **high temp and low pressure** (related to intermolecular forces)
- The ideal gas law allows us to calculate moles (and therefore mass) of a gas if temp, pressure and volume are known.
- Because gases behave ideally at high temperature and low pressure, STP is defined as $\pu{273 K}$ and $\pu{100.00 kPa}$
- Standard ambient temperature and pressure (SATP):
	- The same pressure as STP, but $\pu{298 K}$
- At **STP** one mole of any gas has a volume of $\pu{22.7 L}$
- At **SATP** one mole is instead $\pu{24.8 L}$

## Density
- If the volume or a liquid is unknown, calculate volume using the density formula
- If neither volume nor mass is known, use the molar mass and molar volume at STP
