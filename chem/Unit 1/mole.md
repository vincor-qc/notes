## Laws
- **Law of conservation of mass** (Lavoisier, 1789) - Matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction
	- This allows us to balance equations based on mass balance of atoms
- **Law of definite proportions** (Proust, 1789) - A chemical compound always contains the same proportions of elements by mass
- **Law of multiple proportions** (Dalton, 1808) - If two elements form more than one compound between them, then the ratios of the masses of the two elements will be small whole numbers
	- In conducting experiments that led to a  theory and then to this law, Dalton didnt measure the mass of each element. He assumed that hydrogen was the lightest elements and therefore gave it a mass of 1. Which means the masses of all the element are proportional to hydrogen.

## Definitions

>[!info]
> 1 amu = $\frac{1}{12}$ of the mass of $\ce{^12_6C}$ nucleus

1. **Relative Atomic Mass $\ce{A_r}$** - The mass of one atom of an element relative to the mass of hydrogen
	- Units are in atomic mass units (amu)
	- Carbon is now used instead of H because it is cheaper, in high abundance and easier to measure masses than gases

*The Issue*: atmomic masses do not easily convert to grams, and they are too small to practically weigh

In experiments (empiraically), 1g of hydrogen, 12g of carbon or 23g of sodium were all found to contain $6.02 \times 10^23$ atoms

**Work with Gases** (Gay-Lussac, 1809) - When kept at the same temperature and pressure, the relative columes of gases in a chemical reaction are always in a ratio of small positive integers:
$$\ce{2H_{2(g)} + O_{2(g)} -> 2H_2O_{(g)}}$$
- 2 volumes of hydrogen gas react with 1 volume of oxygen gas to produce 2 volumes of water vapour

>[!info] Avogadro's Hypothesis
>Equal volumes of different gases at the same temperature and pressure contain the same number of particles

- 2 Liters of $\ce{H2, He, Ne, N_2, O_3}$ all contain the same number of particles.

## The mole

>[!danger] Exam Tip
> Avogadro's number is **ROUNDED** to 3 s.f.

- The SI unit for amount of substance.
- 1 mole of "things" = $6.02 \times 10^23$ "things" (this is a conversion factor)
- In chemistry, we must always specify the type of particle involved in a calculation
- The number of moles will also be proportional to the coefficients in the balanced chemical formula.

$$\ce{O + O -> O_2}$$
*2 mol of O atoms combine to make 1 mol of $\ce{O_2}$ molecules*

**Relative formula** - $\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}}$
**Molar Mass** is also known as $\ce{M_r}$ or Molar Mass
	- The mass in grams of 1 mole of the particles that make up the substance
	- It is numerically identical to the formula mass (amu) and has units of $\ce{g mol^{-1}}$. This is a very important conversion factor! 


**Molecules vs. Formal Units (FU)**
Molecules are generally used to describe covalently-bonded substances while formula units are used to describe one **neutral formula unit** of an **ionic compound**. **(Hydrates are ionic)**

E.g., $\ce{NaCl}$ is one FU of sodium chloride, $\ce{CaF_2}$ is one FU of calcium fluoride
